Utils for search quality evaluation

It should have structs and procedures able to evaluate quality of any generic SearchEngine using Query-s from any generic dataset.

- [Precision and Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
- [NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain)
